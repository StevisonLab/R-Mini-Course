# Activity #1: Plotting Coverage along a contig

This laboratory exercise is provided to introduce you to R and the RStudio environment. At the end of this exercise, you should be able to explain the concept of genome coverage, produce a quality plot of coverage along a chromosome and feel comfortable using and working in R and the RStudio environment. You will also learn the importance of reproducibility in bioinformatics research and make a script that they can use afterwards.

For this activity, we have provided a [2 page handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cjoB1En9wHG8O_UDptQovVQUAdE14chjRca5r2ez-R4/edit?usp=sharing). Because R/RStudio changes, this is provided as a link to a google doc so that it may be updated. You can download it as a PDF so that you can print it to follow along. You will also need to download this file: [chr4.depth.out.zip](https://github.com/StevisonLab/R-Mini-Course/blob/main/datafiles/chr4.depth.out.zip).

Optionally, you can download this **[One Page Handout](https://github.com/StevisonLab/R-Mini-Course/blob/main/datafiles/Activity1_intro.pdf)** that explains some of the concepts covered in the activity. 

## Learning objectives:

* Be able to explain the concept of sequence coverage
* Conduct basic summary statistics to evaluate quantitative data in R
* Isolate columns and subset data in R 
* Make simple plots to evaluate data graphically
* Interpret graphs displaying quantitative data
* Reinforce the concept of reproducibility
* Make an R script in RStudio

To check your answers, we have also provided a **[key](https://github.com/StevisonLab/R-Mini-Course/blob/main/datafiles/Activity1Key.Rmd)** for you after you are done with the assignment.
