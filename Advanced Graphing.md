# Advanced Graphing in R

This video covers some more advanced plotting skills (expected to follow Activity #2 where you learn basic skills on your own). You will learn how to plot on two y-axes, write plots to a file, and make multi-panel plots. We will once again revisit the body fat data. 

## Video #4

For this video we will be working with the `BodyFat.csv` dataset again. Make an RScript for this walk-through tutorial to save all the code you will be learning. We will cover:

* Adding text to plots
* Plotting on multiple Axes
* Adding figure legends
* Making multi-panel plots
* Adjusting figure margins
* Writing images to a file
