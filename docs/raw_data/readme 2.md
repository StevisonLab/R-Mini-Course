# Raw data folder contents

This folder contains the "tarball" which contains all the data files for the entire Mini Course. 

If you need practice loading data into R, this file (and all data files) can be found in the compressed directory all_data.tgz.
First, click the link all_data.tgz and then select “Download” to save locally.

Note: Some of these files are also saved as data objects and are available in the "data" folder separately in addition to this tarball.

It is worth noting that R studio will not allow you to uncompress this file once you download it, so you will need to double click it on your computer to uncompress the file. 

After it is uncompressed, you should be able to see all the files in the new folder created called "data" from within R Studio from the files tab (bottom right in default layout).

Within the data folder, the files are organized based on the module structure of this Mini Course to make it easier to find files listed on the module pages. 

Note: Not all modules have files associated with them, so some of the folders may be empty.
