# Data folder contents

This folder contains data objects that are meant to be used with the R-Project. These files can be read directly into R from within the R project once downloaded.

This folder also contains two PDF files that correspond to Activity #1 and the module on Advanced Graphing. 

Check the individual readme files for each module to know which files are relevant to the module you are working with!
