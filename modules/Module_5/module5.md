Module 5: Advanced Graphing in R
================

This video covers some more advanced plotting skills (expected to follow
Activity \#2 where you learn basic skills on your own). You will learn
how to plot on two y-axes, write plots to a file, and make multi-panel
plots. We will once again revisit the body fat data.

## Video \#4

For this video we will be working with the `BodyFat.csv` dataset again.

IF you are well practiced with reading data into R, feel free to read in
our existing data object.

Make an R Notebook for this walk through tutorial to save all the code
you will be learning. We will cover:

- Adding text to plots
- Plotting on multiple Axes
- Adding figure legends
- Making multi-panel plots
- Adjusting figure margins
- Writing images to a file
- Paralleling base R code to `ggplot2` syntax to accomplish the same
  goals
