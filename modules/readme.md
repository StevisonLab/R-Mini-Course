# Modules Folder Contents

In this folder, you will find files that correspond to each of the various modules to help facilitate the downloaded R project. To download the R project, download the entire Mini Course. From the main page of this github repository, click the green **<span style="color:green;"> Code </span>** button. This will open a drop down menu, where you will click **"Download Zip"**. On your local computer, double click this zip file to uncompress it. There, you can double click the R project and it will launch in RStudio.

## How to approach the R project:
Once in the R project, you will see a "Files" tab on the bottom right. There you will click on this folder called "modules" where you should see the same files listed here, but on your local computer.

As you work through the individual modules, click on the folder corresponding to that module/activity to see if there are any html files. These files can be launched within the R project once downloaded. Click the option to "View in Web Browser" for the html slides to launch in your default web browser.

From here, the html slides can act as a companion to the video walkthroughs. They include an explanation and the code used in the videos as well as extra code not part of the videos.

Note: Not all modules/activities will have a companion html document. For example, the first module has no code in the video, so there is no need for a companion document.

For each module, it is recommended that you open either an Rscript or R notebook file to follow along. 

You should paste the code from the html slides into your script/notebook so that you can save your work as you complete the Mini Course. Instructions for opening an RScript can be found in the first activity!
