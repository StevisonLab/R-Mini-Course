# Modules Folder Contents

In this folder, you will find files that correspond to each of the various modules.

For each module, click on the folder to see if there are any html files. These files can be launched within the R project once downloaded.

The html files act as a companion to the video walkthroughs. They include an explanation and the code used in the videos as well as extra code not part of the videos.

Note: Not all modules/activities will have a companion html document. For example, the first module has no code in the video, so there is no need for a companion document.
