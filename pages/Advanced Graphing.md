# Module 4: Advanced Graphing in R

This video covers some more advanced plotting skills (expected to follow Activity #2 where you learn basic skills on your own). You will learn how to plot on two y-axes, write plots to a file, and make multi-panel plots. We will once again revisit the body fat data. 

## Video #4

For this video we will be working with the `BodyFat.csv` dataset again. Make an RScript for this walk-through tutorial to save all the code you will be learning. We will cover:

* Adding text to plots
* Plotting on multiple Axes
* Adding figure legends
* Making multi-panel plots
* Adjusting figure margins
* Writing images to a file

### Walk-through code

* RMarkdown File from video

### Data Files

* BodyFat.csv


### Output PDF

* [Body_Fat.PDF](https://github.com/StevisonLab/R-Mini-Course/blob/main/datafiles/Body_Fat.pdf)

**Associated code and data files are within the compressed data file.**
