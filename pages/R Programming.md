In this video, we will use data from my own lab to learn how to do programming constructs in R. We've already covered for-loops in an earlier video, so in this one we'll cover the following:

* functions
* if-else statements

## Walk-through code

* RScript File from video

## Data files

* Exp5_rawdata.csv

**Associated code and data files are within the compressed data file.**
