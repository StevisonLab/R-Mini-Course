# Data manipulation in R

Learn to bin, transform and add new vectors to datasets in R. You will also install and load packages to build a map using coordinate data.

For this video we will be working with the `USpop.csv` dataset again. Make an RScript for this walk through tutorial to save all the code you will be learning. We will cover:

* Adding new vectors to datasets
* Numeric versus character values
* for loops in R
* transformations
* binning data
* using `maps` to plot points on a map
* Splitting datasets into quantiles
